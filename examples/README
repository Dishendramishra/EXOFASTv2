Especially during beta testing, please email me
(jason.eastman@cfa.harvard.edu) if you have trouble, even if you're
sure it's your problem.

All examples run a minimal fit with only 100 steps per chain for
expediency. They will not mix, but should give roughly correct values
with uncertainties good to a factor of a few on most parameters. These
examples are intended to serve as a template for your own fits and to
test your installation, and will be updated periodically with
additional fits. If they run to completion, EXOFASTv2 is likely
installed correctly (and I haven't introduced a new bug!).

Each fit must have a fit*.pro file, which is the high-level code that
calls exofastv2, a *.prior file to define the starting values and
priors for the fit, and at least one data file. It is strongly
recommended you read and understand the *.prior file and fit*.pro file
before attempting to modify it. More details are in the example files
and in the exofastv2.pro header.

hd106315 - http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....153..256R

Fits a two-planet system with long cadence (/LONGCADENCE) K2 data
(gj9827.Kepler.dat) + SED (gj9827.flux). Note the name of the transit
file must encode the observed band (e.g., Kepler).

Applies priors on Teff and [Fe/H] to constrain the stellar parameters.

Changes default starting values on period, Tc, rp/rstar for both
planets.

Imposes upper limit on extinction from Schlegel et al and Gaussian
parallax prior from Gaia to constrain the SED.

gj9827 - http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv170901957R

Fits a 3-planet system with long cadence (/LONGCADENCE) K2 data
(hd106315.Kepler.dat) + SED (hd106315.flux). Note the name of the
transit file must encode the observed band (e.g., Kepler).

Disables YY stellar evolutionary tracks (/NOYY) because it is
marginally applicable for low-mass stars, and instead directly imposes
stellar mass and radius priors obtained elsewhere.

Imposes loose uniform priors on limb darkening based on Claret &
Bloeman, 2011. Disables integrated limb darkening interpolation
(/NOCLARET) because they are not applicable for low-mass stars and may
bias the logg, Teff, and [Fe/H].

Changes default starting values on period, Tc, rp/rstar, cosi, and K
for all three planets.

Imposes upper limit on extinction from Schlegel et al and Gaussian
parallax prior from Hipparcos to constrain the SED.

hat3 -- recreates HAT-P-3b example from original EXOFAST paper
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013PASP..125...83E

Fits a HAT-P-3b with transit (n20070428.Sloani.KepCam.dat) and RV
(hat3.rv) data. Note the name of the transit file must encode the
observed band (Sloani).

Fixes variance and jittervariance.

Disables YY (/NOYY) and imposes Torres relations (/TORRES). 

Forces a circular orbit (circular=[1])
