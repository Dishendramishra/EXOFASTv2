Especially during beta testing, please email me
(jason.eastman@cfa.harvard.edu) if you have trouble, even if you're
sure it's your problem.

Most examples run a minimal fit with only 100 steps per chain for
expediency. They will not mix (not good enough for publication!), but
should give roughly correct values with uncertainties good to a factor
of a few on most parameters. These examples are intended to serve as
templates for your own fits and to test your installation. They will
be updated periodically with additional fits. If they run to
completion, EXOFASTv2 is likely installed correctly (and I haven't
introduced a new bug!).

Each fit must have a fit*.pro file, which is the high-level code that
calls exofastv2, a *.prior file to define the starting values and
priors for the fit, and at least one data file. It is strongly
recommended you read and understand the *.prior file and fit*.pro file
before attempting to modify it. More details are in the example files,
the exofastv2.pro header, and $EXOFAST_PATH/parnames.README.

hd106315 - http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....153..256R

Fits a two-planet system with long cadence (/LONGCADENCE) K2 data
(gj9827.Kepler.dat) + SED (gj9827.flux). Note the name of the transit
lightcurve file must encode the observed band (e.g., Kepler).

Applies priors on Teff and [Fe/H] to constrain the stellar parameters.

Changes default starting values on period, Tc, rp/rstar for both
planets.

Imposes upper limit on extinction from Schlegel et al and Gaussian
parallax prior from Gaia to constrain the SED.

gj9827 - http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv170901957R

Fits a 3-planet system with long cadence (/LONGCADENCE) K2 data
(hd106315.Kepler.dat) + SED (hd106315.flux). Note the name of the
transit file must encode the observed band (e.g., Kepler).

Disables YY stellar evolutionary tracks (/NOYY) because it is
marginally applicable for low-mass stars, and instead directly imposes
stellar mass and radius priors obtained elsewhere.

Imposes loose uniform priors on limb darkening based on Claret &
Bloeman, 2011. Disables integrated limb darkening interpolation
(/NOCLARET) because they are not applicable for low-mass stars and may
bias the logg, Teff, and [Fe/H].

Changes default starting values on period, Tc, rp/rstar, cosi, and K
for all three planets.

Imposes upper limit on extinction from Schlegel et al and Gaussian
parallax prior from Hipparcos to constrain the SED.

hat3 -- recreates HAT-P-3b example from original EXOFAST paper
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013PASP..125...83E

Fits a HAT-P-3b with transit (n20070428.Sloani.KepCam.dat) and RV
(hat3.rv) data. Note the name of the transit file must encode the
observed band (Sloani).

Fixes variance and jittervariance.

Disables YY (/NOYY) and imposes Torres relations (/TORRES). 

Forces a circular orbit (circular=[1])

*************************************************************************
hat3_nolicense -- same as above, but run without requiring an IDL
license like this:

cd $EXOFAST_PATH/examples/hat3_nolicense
idl -arg $EXOFAST_PATH/examples/hat3_nolicense/hat3.args -vm=$EXOFAST_PATH/exofastv2.sav

NOTE: EXOFAST_PATH is the only environment variable recognized inside
the arg file. The full path must be given for all files.
*************************************************************************

hat3/hat3_comparestar.pro -- explores several methods of constraining the
stellar parameters. Makes a pretty plot at the end comparing them all.

*************************************************************************

kelt4rvonly -- Fits only the RV data from the KELT-4Ab discovery paper
(http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AJ....151...45E). This is meant to
be a demonstration of what you might expect for a system where you
have no transit data, not to match the published results. As such,
many parameters are biased relative to the published values because we
are agnostic to the inclination and radius in this example fit.

This fit uses the Chen & Kipping relation to estimate the planet
radius. It will also marginalize over cosi to derive a true mass
posterior (as well as more precise msini) and posteriors on transit
durations without the assumption that it transits. Note, however, that
the vast majority of a uniform distribution on cosi implies the planet
does not transit. It'll issue warnings that various parameters (T14,
Tau, TFWHM, etc) are singularly valued (meaning all values within +/-
1 sigma of the median are identical). These warnings can be safely
ignored in this case because the transit duration of a non-transiting
planet is 0. The practical consequence of this warning is that it
won't generate some plots for those parameters and the value in the
output table won't have error bars.

You may wish to restore the idl save file and exclude non transiting
solutions (transit = where(mcmcss.planet.b.value lt
1d0+mcmcss.planet.p.value)) if you'd like to know what
durations/depths to expect if it does transit.

************************************************************************

kelt6 -- Fits KELT-6 data from the discovery paper
(http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AJ....147...39C) and the follow-up
HARPS RVs detecting planet c
(http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...581L...6D). Uses MIST
stellar tracks, an SED, three RV telescopes, three transits (in two
wavelengths and using both additive and multiplicative detrending),
and two planets (one with transit data and one without).
