All examples run a minimal fit with only 100 steps/chain for
expediency. They will not mix, but should give roughly correct values
with uncertainties good to a factor of a few on most parameters. These
examples are intended to serve as a template for your own fits and to
test your installation, and will be updated periodically with
additional published fits. If they run to completion, EXOFASTv2 is
likely installed correctly.

Fits a two-planet system with K2 data + SED.

Applies priors on Teff and [Fe/H] to constrain the stellar parameters.

Changes default starting values on period, Tc, rp/rstar for both
planets.

Imposes upper limit on extinction from Schlegel et al and Gaussian
parallax prior from Gaia to constrain the SED.

Fits a 3-planet system with K2 data + SED

Disables YY stellar evolutionary tracks (NOYY) because it is
marginally applicable for low-mass stars, and instead directly imposes
stellar mass and radius priors obtained elsewhere.

Imposes loose uniform priors on limb darkening based on Claret &
Bloeman, 2011. Disables integrated limb darkening (/NOCLARET) because
they are not applicable for low-mass stars.

Changes default starting values on period, Tc, rp/rstar, cosi, and K
for all three planets.

Imposes upper limit on extinction from Schlegel et al and Gaussian
parallax prior from Gaia to constrain the SED.
