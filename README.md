# EXOFASTv2
An exoplanet transit and radial velocity fitting software package in IDL

# This is a BETA version. EXPECT BUGS!!! And please report them to jason.eastman@cfa.harvard.edu.

# It is also poorly documented. Good luck with that. Feel free to email me questions.

# Eventually, this will be a stand alone package, but for now it is built on EXOFAST. Install it first.
